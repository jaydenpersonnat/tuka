/** 
Functionality
-------------
create an input field that takes in an alphabetical string input and displays 
the most frequent letter in the given string.
If there are ties, then show all of the most frequent characters in the given string. 

User Interface 
--------------
- Header to indicate purpose of page
- An input field for user to enter an alpha-only string
- A button a user clicks when they are ready to process the string
- An area where the most frequent letter will become visible

Stretch goal: implement the component such that the most frequent character automatically updates 
as the user is typing 

Ideally, implement a solution that runs in O(n) time

Styling 
--------
Styling is not a priority, but you can choose to either use in-line css styling, a css 
stylesheet, Tailwind, or a combination of those options.
